You might\nneed to ask clarifying questions in order to get this from the user.\n- The same session_id can be reused as long as the situation and task remain the same\n- If user wants to forecast a different use case, create a new session and then use that\n\nHow to use this tool:\n- To create a session, you need to provide a situation and task that describe the forecasting use case \n- If the user has not provided enough detail for you to decompose the use case into a \n    situation (broad or background context) and task (specific requirements for the forecast), \n    ask them to elaborate since more detail will result in a better / more accurate forecast.\n- Once created, this will generate a unique session_id that can be used to when calling other tools about this use case.\n"

Rescaling can be used as a rough first-pass estimate. But for best results, \n    it would be better to start a new Chronulus forecasting use case predicting in levels from the start.\n    \nHow to use this tool:\n- To use this tool present prediction_id from the normalized prediction and the min and max as floats\n- If the user is also changing units, consider if the units will be inverted and set the inverse scale to True if needed.\n- When plotting the rescaled predictions, use a Rechart time series plot with the appropriate axes labeled and include the chronulus \n    prediction explanation as a caption below the plot. \n- If you would like to add additional notes about the scaled series, put these below the original prediction explanation. \n"
