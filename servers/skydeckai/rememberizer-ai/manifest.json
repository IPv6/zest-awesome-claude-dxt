Consider using the tool list_internal_knowledge_systems to find out which are available. Use the tool list_internal_knowledge_systems to find out which sources are available. \n\nYou can specify a from_datetime_ISO8601 and a to_datetime_ISO8601, and you should look at the context of your request to make sure you put reasonable parameters around this by, for example, converting a reference to recently to a start date two weeks before today, or converting yesterday to a timeframe during the last day. But do be aware of the effect of time zone differences in the source data and for the requestor."
