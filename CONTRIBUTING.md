## Example: Python (uvx) Server

**Step-by-step:**

1. Clone your MCP server into the `servers` folder (skip if using `npx` or `uvx`).
   - Folder structure: `servers/{owner}/{repo}` or `servers/{author}/{mcp-server}`
2. Create a `manifest.json` in your server folder.
3. Install DXT CLI:
   ```sh
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/dxt
   ```
4. Pack your DXT:
   ```sh
   dxt pack
   ```
5. Add your server to the list, e.g.:
   - [servers/ahujasid/blender-mcp](./servers/ahujasid/blender-mcp)

**Sample `manifest.json`:**
```json
{
  "dxt_version": "0.1",
  "name": "blender-mcp",
  "display_name": "Blender",
  "version": "1.2",
  "description": "Blender Model Context Protocol Integration",
  "author": {
    "name": "ahujasid"
  },
  "server": {
    "type": "python",
    "entry_point": "main.py",
    "mcp_config": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "blender-mcp@1.2"
      ]
    }
  },
