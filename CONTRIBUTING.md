## How to Contribute

### Simple way

if your mcp server use npx or uvx, just create a `manifest.json` at your repo root
and test then list at this repo

- servers/{owner}/{repo}/manifest.json
- Create a PR to this repo list by category

### Full way

- Add new `.dxt` tools or resources under the appropriate category
- Add manifest.json to your mcp server, see example below
- Fix typos or improve descriptions
- Keep the list alphabetically sorted within each category
- Ensure links are valid and point to useful content

### example

#### uvx example

##### Step

1. clone your mcp server to folder [servers](./servers) (uvx or npx can skip this step)
  - create a folder owner/repo or author/mcp-server
2. create manifest.json in the folder
3. install dxt

```sh
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/dxt
```

4. pack dxt

```sh
dxt pack
```

- [servers/ahujasid/blender-mcp](./servers/ahujasid/blender-mcp)

`manifest.json`

```json
{
  "dxt_version": "0.1",
